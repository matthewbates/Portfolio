                    <p>
                      I'm a software engineer residing in Manitou Springs, CO.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Having worked in corporate America for a handful of years,
                      I've had many interactions with enterprise software
                      development. It became apparent that I had a passion for
                      not only technology, but also user design. Making things
                      more accessable & setting new standards that could be used
                      across the world-wide-web is what drove me to get into the
                      field.
